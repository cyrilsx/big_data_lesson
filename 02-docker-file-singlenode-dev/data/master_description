Given the increasing importance of "big data" in the economy, GSEM offers a new master program in Business Analytics that provides a wide range of career opportunities. At the intersection between data science, statistics and management, Business Analytics consists of using data to inform strategic decision making under uncertainty and to optimise business processes. In the digital economy with the proliferation of data, businesses have understood the tactical and strategic importance of analytics – the learning from data – as a critical field to detect and monitor client behaviours and expectations, or even future market trends.

career opportunities

With the proliferation of data and the present lack of analytical talent, students of the Master in Business Analytics will have excellent career opportunities across the globe. The McKinsey Global Institute estimated in 2016 a demand of 2 to 4 million “business translators” that serve as the link between analytical talent and practical business applications in the US economy by 2026. In 2017, the Business Higher Education Forum and PricewaterhouseCoopers projected data science and analytics-related job postings in the US alone to grow from 2.35 million in 2015 to 2.72 million by 2020.
